# S&S Parking CO.

## Description
S&S Parking CO, is a project develpoed by Shayne and Sarah for their coding temple assignment.
Durning this project Shayne and Sarah worked tirelessly to create a functional parking garage, that tells users how much they owe and what spaces are available to park in. When the user leaves the system updates to make sure new users know what spaces are available.


### Executing program
First the system will ask a user what they would like to do
Second user will select their desired option.
When a user says they want to park they will then be prompted for their name. !Important! Names are case sensitive.
A user can then Settle up and pay their bill, a prompt asking for their name will appear, and once the user puts in their name (again its CASE SENSITIVE) then they will see they now have 'paid' by their name
